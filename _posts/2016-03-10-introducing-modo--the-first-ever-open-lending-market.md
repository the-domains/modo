MODO grants _any_ individual _regardless of credit score_ the opportunity to borrow in times of financial distress. The platform connects users that are in need of capital (between $20 and $1,000) with ordinary people that have some extra cash and are looking for investments that are less volatile than the stock market but more lucrative than a basic savings account. Both parties are given the opportunity to interact and determine their _own _agreements for the transaction. 

MODO allows individuals experiencing financially good times to help those unfortunate to find themselves in one of those budgetary lows that many of us know too well. It allows us to tackle financial troubles together and provides a platform that places the power where it belongs - _right in the hands of users_.  

**Personal Finance, welcome to the 21st century. Meet [MODO][0].   **
