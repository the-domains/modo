description: "MODO allows ANY individual--no matter the credit score--to borrow in times of financial distress. The platform connects users that are in need of capital--ranging from $20 - $1,000--with every day individuals that have some extra cash and are looking for investments that are less volatile than the stock market and more lucrative than a simple savings account. Both parties will then be given the opportunity to interact and decide on their OWN terms.\_"

MODO allows ANY individual--no matter the credit score--to borrow in times of financial distress. The platform connects users that are in need of capital--ranging from $20 - $1,000--with every day individuals that have some extra cash and are looking for investments that are less volatile than the stock market and more lucrative than a simple savings account. Both parties will then be given the opportunity to interact and decide on their OWN terms. 

With MODO, individuals riding a financial high can help those unfortunate to find themselves in one of the lows that many of us know so well. MODO allows us to tackle financial troubles together, and provides a platform that places the power where it belongs--in the hands of the users.  

**Personal Finance, meet the 21st century. Meet [MODO][0].   **
