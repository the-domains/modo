# Redefining personal finance.

We live in a different era now, start banking like it. 

You have a device that connects the world around you able to provide rides, food, friends and dates - why are you still banking like your parents?

We've all gone through periods of tight budgeting - unexpected car problems, dog and cat got sick, that one vacation trip where everything went wrong - and your credit card penalized you at 25% because you still need to pay rent and eat. 

Meanwhile, your neighbor is experiencing good financial times. She was able to put a couple bills in her savings account and for that the bank is rewarding her with an _amazing _rate of... 1% (if her bank is nice).

Introducing MODO.

With MODO you are able to borrow in times of need at a mutually agreed and much better rate with someone who is going through better times; **saving borrowers money and benefiting lenders**. 

We all go through ups and downs in life, let's experience them together.

This is MODO - welcome to 21st century personal finance.
