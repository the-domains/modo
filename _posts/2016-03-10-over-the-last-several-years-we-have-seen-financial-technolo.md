Over the past several years, we have seen financial technology disrupt the traditional banking model and start bringing finance into the 21st century. Our generation has transitioned to lifestyle in which mobile applications and social media have come together to make everyday activities \[e.g. shopping \#Amazon, transportation \#Uber, delivery \#Grubhub, dating \#Tinder\] seamless and easily accessible. So why is finance - particularly the mobile credit market - nonexistent?

For many of us, financial stability is characterized by ups and downs. We all go through periods of tight budgeting due to unexpected car issues, medical visits, increases in daily expenses, or the overall cyclical effects of our economy. Whatever the reason, we rely on credit to help alleviate some of the financial stress. 

The problem? Credit cards and loan services charge absurdly high rates -especially to those that need capital the most. High interest is overwhelming and makes it difficult to meet the monthly payments. 

So what are we forced to do? Take out more credit cards and loans in order to  meet these obligations - and thus begins the viscous cycle of never ending interest on payments.

While companies such as Lending Club, Prosper, and OnDeck have helped alleviate some of this pain, these platforms are not easily accessible to everyone. However, even those able to gain access are not appropriately served. Why? 

**_Because _****_the users are not given the power to drive or set their own terms._**

If you will be the one paying off a loan or providing the line of credit, does it not make sense for you to have input on the prevailing rate in order to ensure that you place yourself in a suitable position for both repayment or capital gains? 

This comprehensive process is _only _possible in an open marketplace where borrowers and lenders are given the opportunity to propose, negotiate and ultimately reach an agreement that guarantees to leave both parties satisfied.
