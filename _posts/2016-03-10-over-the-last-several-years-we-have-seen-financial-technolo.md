Over the last several years, we have seen financial technology disrupt the traditional banking model and help start bringing finance into the 21st century. Our generation has transitioned into a lifestyle in which mobile applications and social media have come together to make everyday activities (i.e. shopping (Amazon), transportation (Uber / Lyft), delivery (Grubhub), dating (Tinder), etc.) seamless and easily accessible. Yet, why is it that finance--particularly the mobile credit market--is non-existant?

For many of us, financial stability is filled with its ups and downs. We all go through periods of tight budgeting--whether it be due to unexpected car issues, medical visits, increases in general day-to-day expenses, or the overall cyclical effects of the U.S. economy. Whatever the reason may be, we rely on credit to help alleviate some of the financial distress. The problem? Credit cards and loan services often charge absurdly high rates--especially to those that ultimately need the capital the most. Often, the high interest can become too overwhelming, and make it very difficult to meet our mandatory monthly payments. So what are we forced to do? Take on more credit cards / loans in order to ensure that we meet these obligations--and so begins the viscous cycle of never ending interest payments. Credit is meant to serve as an aid to help us crawl out of financial burden, not dig us into an even bigger hole. (May want to cut this out entirely?)

Sure, companies such as Lending Club, Prosper, and OnDeck have helped alleviate some of the pain, however, these platforms cannot be accessed by those who truly need them (i.e. those with a sub par credit history). And even those that do have access are still not efficiently served. Why? 

**_Because _****_the users are not given the power to drive / set their own terms._**

If you are the one who is going to be paying off / providing the line of credit, does it not make sense for you to have a say on the prevailing rate in order to ensure that you place yourself in the best position--both for repayment and capital gains? Such an inclusive process can only be possible in an open marketplace where borrowers and lenders are given the opportunity to propose, negotiate, and ultimately reach an agreement that guarantees to leave BOTH parties satisfied.   ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/79be18dc485d599ace838a5ba1e7fb39991d7f60.jpg)
