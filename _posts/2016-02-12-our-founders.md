**Founders: Edwin Loredo || Cuauhtémoc Ocampo**

Our founders were born and raised in SoCal before venturing east to New Jersey where they both attained their undergraduate degrees in Economics at Princeton University. 

Over the years, having met during their first week as freshmen, they developed kinship through constant discussion of ideas ranging from services to investment information. It was only a matter of time before they developed a keen understanding of the power of technology and the social inefficiencies that can be bridged with it. 

After graduating each went their separate way, one to New York and the other Dallas. However, friendship and the drive to make the world a better place will always transcend physical distance.

**App Development: Viveque Ramji**

Our student developer is from London, currently studying Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering and intending to attain certificates in Computer Science and Operations, Research and Financial Engineering.  
In addition to academics, Viveque is on the Varsity Lightweight Rowing team, Tech Chair of the Princeton Hidden Minority Council, and aiding the development of this revolutionary platform. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/604a1a49b4eacc7954484fd678c06cf17f30a436.png)

It is with great excitement they bring personal finance to the 21st century, and a pleasure to bring you **MODO**.
